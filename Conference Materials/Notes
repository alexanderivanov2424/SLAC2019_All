three Cs

setup the problem
motivation - clustering/ missing peaks

cosine similarity doesn't catch small peaks for clustering

talk about the challenges and issues 


peak finding:

challenges:

0) computational problem takes time

1) overlapping peaks that create sholders

2) realpeaks or noise (show heat map noise region)

explain logic of Robbert's code


divide data into blocks each block has 1 peak
(each block should have only one peak)
(but because of sholder peaks blocks can have more than one peak)

different ways of finding blocks

different ways of fitting / optimizing curve fits


examples: 85 peak_finding_plot

PeakParams on heat plot - what we are finding and what we are not finding. The problem we are still struggling with.






____________________________________




Synchrotron has a lot of data

advances in synchrotron tech has allowed massive data collection
new bottle new between experiments -> data (->) knowledge

Before bottle neck was collecting data but now we can collect data much faster

how can we analyze it more effectively cant have people going through manually



Our task

we are looking for metalic glasses - screening a variety of materials

identify different phases show some diffraction patterns how can we bin them

simply way - cosine clustering

through out talking about diffraction patterns


slides 5 and 6 highlight peaks in diff patterns

transition to peaks:

cosine isn't focusing on data features (presence not intensity)


only talk about fix curve numbers

Further directions:

improve algorithm BBA is probably not the best 
other aproaches:
- relatively simple aproach based on what an expert would do
(group data and point at peaks)
- machine learning learning to detect peaks
- talk to apurva



____________________________________

Focus on blocking
add min blocking mention
number of peaks - fit until max or until residual matches noise
why do we block - faster easier to fit peaksx










_______________________________________

asymetric peak before after for slide 26

backgorund - state problems then explain 

restate question, say it is good, then go to explination


explicitly state why we want to use this
what other methods exist what are we different
- no information apriory
- we want to do this rapidly

comments
- talk about graphs in 2
- 6 what is the diffraction pattern exaplin plot

- 5 reducing information from measurement to knowledge
why are we collecting measurements for knowledge
extract high level information that is scientifically relevant

each diff pattern gives us a dot on the phase diagram

only useful information is where the peaks are
this is feature extraction

we may think that we can extract local maxima but it is bad
animate local maxima issue


putting it all together show peaks fit on full patterns
- runs fast
- no information
- now we can apply this for creating phase diagrams, ML problems, automations

further directions slide:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
show phase diagram - draw line - we can use this information

comments part 2:

Robert is supposed to be giving this talk but he cannot make it

thank department of energy
better logo - and stanford logo

slide 8 - why cant other software fit this
- we don't know how many peaks we have
- (backup) build into our built in data analysis ( backup )

slide 8 - one way of doing this blocking is BBA

slide 10 - we have been working with jeff scargle from nasa ames ont his method
"jeff scargle suggested the use of this algortihm to us"


slide 14 - we can merge blocks point out that we skip over noise region with noise peaks

mark important slides***

slide 18 - equations to backup slides
 - assumption peak shape (voight) in paranthesis


slide 23 - difference plot - looks like noise no need to further fit peaks

slide 25 - fits this ugly looking peak on right
throw away left - background

slide 26 - animation

slide 26 B curves fit to full diffractions

slide 27 - break up
phase diagram explain heat map



- we want a open source pipeline - we need source code for other programs
- can I have your code


thankyou slide with message and key pictures from talk
thankyou slide - when we finish this code will be published - roberts emails

backup slide with the simulated peak fitting

custering


slide 6 you are familiar with these diffractions
I am told the most useful info is the peaks (params)
we need these to go to phases and how they change  - knowledge

easy prop local max - subtlyties

profile shape function

EXTRACTION - pull back to feature extraction when applicable

what is the best low rank representation of the data

can be paralelized bc indepen peices

slide 16 - lets take a step step look at what this looks at
I may have lost you lets look at it step by step


large blocks are usually background

18 - reduce the problem - only 12 blocks search for maxima in block middles
backup slide with correct blocking actual blocks are slightly diff

if middle peak block - if side we merge it go to lise 21

slide 26 add green dot and green border to make connection


slide 27 is not noise so we iterate next local maxima
title NOISE YPEAKS

transition to highly overlapping peaks

lets look at an example where we go beyond human perseption

slide 35 enlarge
%%
title::
Robust
Fast 
Automatic
beyond perseption

%%
slide 31 - split

i have coupel of minutes where do we want to go from here

slid 39 - small peaks
	- asymetric peaks versus overlapping peaks
	 - title :: aditional information

slide 40 - BLOCKING and CURVE FITTING
strategy for peak extraction through these two methodsa

Conclustion - Thankyou animate (robbert appears for thankyou)
